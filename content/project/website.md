I never really tried making a website for a couple of reasons:

1. I prefer modern explicit languages like Rust.
2. I don't consider myself to be good at UI design.

I had tried to get into website creation twice before (once with pure HTML/CSS,
and once with Yew/Rust) before landing on the simplicity of a SSG, specifically
[Zola](https://www.getzola.org).

Turns out, it wasn't as bad as I thought.
